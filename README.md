# speech-based-search-engine
This script creates a voice-activated Google search assistant.   It uses `speech_recognition` to convert speech into text.   `pyttsx3` provides voice feedback to the user.   Recognized queries are searched on Google using `webbrowser`.   Errors in recognition or service are handled with spoken responses.
